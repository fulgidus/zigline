# Zigline

An experimental terminal emulator written in Zig.

## Overview

Zigline is an early-stage personal project aimed at exploring Zig's capabilities for building a lightweight terminal emulator. This project is **not production-ready** and serves as a learning exercise and exploration of Zig's systems programming features.

## Features (Planned)

- [x] Basic project structure
- [ ] Terminal screen buffer management
- [ ] ANSI escape sequence processing
- [ ] Pseudo-terminal (PTY) interface
- [ ] Input handling and key processing
- [ ] Text rendering and display
- [ ] Command execution and process management
- [ ] Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Customizable configuration
- [ ] Plugin system

## Requirements

- Zig 0.13.0 or later
- Linux/Unix-like system (initial target platform)

## Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd zigline

# Build the project
zig build

# Run the terminal emulator
zig build run

# Run tests
zig build test
```

## Development

This project is in its early experimental phase. The current implementation provides:

- Basic project structure
- Simple command-line interface
- Foundation for terminal emulation features
